## Framework Choice: Flask

I selected Flask for the following reasons:

- **Simplicity**: Flask's minimalist design offers essential web development tools without complexity.

- **Ease of Learning**: Its beginner-friendly nature allowed me to launch the project with minimal knowledge.

- **Testing Support**: Flask's built-in testing support ensured app's reliability and correctness.
